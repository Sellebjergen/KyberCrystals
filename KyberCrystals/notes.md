# Notes for the project
These are my notes for the PQP project regarding coding of the CRYSTALS-kyber algorithm.
The specification can be found on the following link https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/data/kyber-specification-round3-20210804.pdf.

## TODO:
* Clean the code and the unit tests.
* Implement modulo for functions
  * 2 versions
* euclidian gcd function implementation???
* Read this seemingly good introduction to Kyber https://cryptopedia.dev/posts/kyber/

## Questions for Diego
1. first
    * NTT, We need to discuss what this is exactly.
      * seems to be some kind of fourier transformation
    * How do I get my functions well tested?
      * It is not very easy to test the project and its different functions.
    * When using Shake256, does it make a difference if I update with a bytearray and then a byte? should I update it all just one array where the byte is concatenated?
    * I seems as if I have some kind of mistake when using bouncy castle shake implementation, as i Can't control the output length of the hash.
      * https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/shake_256.html
    * How to calculate A o s + e, we agree that is just normal matrix multiplication?

2. second
   * This value NN is the product of two primes pp and qq, both of which are 2048 bits, and which are known during decryption.
     * not necessarely true, right?

## Questions for SÃ¸ren
* Usage of Get property in C#
* How do I organise unit tests? One test for Add, Mult etc and then a lot of theories? - seems to give bad naming as to what is wrong.

## number theoretic transform (NTT)

## People trying to use PQP encryption

## Current plan for project
1. Make an implementation of the CRYSTALS-Kyber
2. See how it fits into DB structure
   * Performance test
   * Mock the HSM module
3. Code Dilithium
4. Look at security guarantees.
   * Maybe speak with katarina for this one.
